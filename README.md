## Problem Statement
Existing grievance redressal platforms such as CPGRAMS rely heavily on manual complaint classification and routing. This results in:

- Delayed complaint resolution
- High manual workload on authorities
- Poor prioritization of urgent complaints
- Lack of transparency for citizens

---

## Proposed Solution
An AI-powered grievance redressal prototype that uses NLP and Machine Learning to automatically classify, prioritize, and track complaints.

---

## Key Features
- Automatic complaint classification (Water, Electricity, Roads, Police, etc.)
- Priority prediction using sentiment and urgency
- Chatbot-based complaint status tracking
- Structured output for authority dashboards

## System Flow (High-Level)
